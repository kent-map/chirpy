description: "This essay examines the Island of Sheppey’s strategic vulnerability during the Anglo-Dutch War, focusing on the 1667 Raid on the Medway and the fall of Sheerness. It compares a contemporary narrative map with other visual sources and Samuel Pepys’s diary to show how events were recorded, misdated, and understood by witnesses and later interpreters."

The Island of [Sheppey](Q1500299) was at the centre of the famous Medway attack during the Anglo Dutch War (c.1664-1667).  The <span data-mouseover-image-zoomto="2867,2126,1423,812">island</span> was in a vulnerable position at the entrance to both the Medway and Thames Rivers.

The British Library Map 1240 of the Dutch Invasion of the Medway by General Bouttate, c.1666 is misleading since the Dutch invasion of the Medway took place between the 12th and the 14th June 1667, a year after the map was produced.  According to the mapmaker, Sheppey’s northern coastline appeared to be heavily under fire with [Sheerness](Q1003196) Fort captured on the Dutch approach to the Medway and a second battle taking place on the way back when the Dutch held provisions on the northern half of Sheppey to secure its base in the southeast.

Samuel Pepys records in his diary dated 10th June 1667 that Sheerness and Gravesend witnessed the exodus of local people as they fled in fear of the Dutch.  The taking of Sheerness was most likely very easy since there was no army to defend it and military support was not adequately provided by the Crown, in addition to the ruinous state of the castle at Queenborough that was destroyed during the Commonwealth period.
