Installed in the [River Stour](/landscape/literary-stour/) in [Canterbury](Q29303) in 2024, Jason deCaires Taylor’s 'Alluvia' sculpture was inspired by Sir John Everett Millais’s celebrated 1852 painting _Ophelia_.

Taylor’s installations are created using low carbon, PH-neutral materials to provide habitat for marine life and, in turn, help to rebuild ecosystems. They also divert tourists away from particularly fragile spots in hopes of providing some breathing room for restoration. 

In Taylor’s own words, ‘the marine life completes the sculpture's’. He explains, ‘Over time, reeds will grow around her, algae will form a natural patina, and she will be subject to the river’s ebb and flow – both in water levels and clarity.’[^ref1]  'Alluvia' is made out of recycled glass and marine stainless steel, but she is also set in a resin in order for the sand to move back into the glass as erosion takes place.

'Alluvia' refers to the ‘alluvial deposits of sand left behind by the rise and fall of the river’s water levels’.[^ref2]  The sculpture is also illuminated at night by golden LED lights and is fitted with sensors that record the surrounding water conditions. So the purpose is very much an integration between contemporary art and environmental conservation. 

'Alluvia' has gained a range of responses and, like many of Taylor’s works, sparked controversy. Some suggested that Alluvia evokes suicide or even migrant deaths in the English Channel, a subject which Taylor says, ‘certainly deserves more empathy and attention’. However, the artist has clarified that his intention is “not to divide”, but to welcome thoughtful questions and interpretations. 

Taylor has also highlighted the need to acknowledge mankind’s fragility compared to the natural world. Like _the_ Ophelia, 'Alluvia' is completely at the mercy of nature yet also one with water – a duality that is tragically beautiful.
