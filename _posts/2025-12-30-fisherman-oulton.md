title: "The Fisherman's Bride"
description: "A coastal museum exhibit in Folkestone reshapes shipwreck remnants and salvaged gear into a charged portrait of a fisherman’s bride. Salt, wind, and polished wood turn marriage and mourning into maritime material culture, where preservation and decay sit side by side."

Polished light glances off the wood.   

The wheel is salvaged always   
and lives where possible.   
The wreckage makes a collection box.   
In time odd pieces float   
in to the glass of the museum.

The fisherman’s bride in the corner   
wears silk stiff as bones.   
Wind and salt are peeling   
the skin off the beach.   
The fisherman’s bride is dressed   
in the colours of the sea.
