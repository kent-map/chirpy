title: "Dymchurch"
description: "Dymchurch on the Kent coast links seaside landscape to a cluster of writers and artists, including Paul Nash, Noel Coward, E. Nesbit, and Russell Thorndike. Heritage trail markers and artworks like Charles Sims’s The Sands at Dymchurch show how the beach and town became a source of inspiration and local cultural memory."
