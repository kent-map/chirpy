title: "Margate Beach"
description: "A lyric poem set on Margate Beach that layers a present-day seaside moment with a 1930 fictional stabbing and the atmosphere of Dreamland. It explores how place holds traces of story and memory, with clues and sensations read from the shoreline itself."

I was in a different shelter,   

same sands, when gull wings   
started strobing the sky.   
In 1930 a fictional   
blackmailer was stabbed   
in a deck chair on this beach -   
the clues are scribbled on the sea.   
In Dreamland, previously Sanger’s,   
(which also features in the book)   
a man in yellow is bouncing a ball,   
rain taps on the ground   
and my baby don’t care.
