# The Big Bloom 

##
{: .wrap}

1698 was a special year for the [Hortus botanicus Leiden](Q42), the oldest botanical garden in the Netherlands. After 96 years, its exotic "Aloe Americana" (or _Agave americana_, as it is classified today), bloomed for the first time. To commemorate the marvelous event, the Hortus commissioned an illustrated print of the plant.[^ref1] A surviving poster-sized print, recently added to the Dumbarton Oaks Rare Book Collection, reveals sixteenth and seventeenth century European botanists’ fascination with the so-called "century plant" and provides a lens to explore the history of agave—a plant that has shaped human societies across three continents.
