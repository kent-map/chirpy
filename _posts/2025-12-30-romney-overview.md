title: "Romney Marsh"
description: "Romney Marsh emerges as a flat, dyke-crossed wetland landscape between Hythe and the Sussex border, shaped by drainage channels and coastal exposure. Literary and guidebook writing links the marsh to smuggling, sheep, and folklore, turning geography into a distinctive regional identity."

'The world, according to the best geographers, is divided into Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Romney Marsh. In this last-named and fifth quarter of the globe, a witch may still be occasionally discovered in favourable, i.e. stormy, seasons, weathering Dungeness Point in an egg-shell, or careering on her broomstick over Dymchurch wall.' - _Mrs Botherby's Story: The Leech of [Folkestone](Q375314)._[^ref1]

The Romney Marsh has long been associated with smuggling and sheep. In his guide to Kent, John Thorne described it as:

'the crescent-shaped tract of flat land stretching from Hythe to the Sussex border, criss-crossed with dykes and channels.'[^ref2]
