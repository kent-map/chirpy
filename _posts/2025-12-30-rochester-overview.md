title: "Rochester"
description: "Rochester emerges as a Kentish crossroads of literature, performance, science, and politics anchored by the cathedral, castle, bridge, and inns along the Medway. Dickens’s transformation of the city into Cloisterham sits alongside visitor and birth-place anecdotes from figures such as Pepys, Henslow, Dadd, Ternan, and Bagnold, showing how urban places accumulate layered cultural memory across centuries."

'An ancient city, Cloisterham, and no meet dwelling-place for any one with hankerings after the noisy world. A monotonous, silent city, deriving an earthy flavour throughout from its Cathedral crypt, and so abounding in vestiges of monastic graves, that the Cloisterham children grow small salad in the dust of abbots and abbesses, and make dirt-pies of nuns and friars; while every ploughman in its outlying fields renders to once puissant Lord Treasurers, Archbishops, Bishops, and such-like, the attention which the Ogre in the story-book desired to render to his unbidden visitor, and grinds their bones to make his bread.'

Charles Dickens's fictionalised Rochester as Cloisterham in his novel _The Mystery of Edwin Drood_

'Bright and pleasant was the sky, balmy the air, and beautiful the appearance of every object around, as Mr. Pickwick leaned over the balustrades of Rochester Bridge, contemplating nature, and waiting for breakfast.
