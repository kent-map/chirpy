description: "Derek Jarman’s years at Prospect Cottage in Dungeness link an austere shingle landscape to a late burst of artistic work in film, writing, and gardening. The garden’s open boundaries and improvised planting become both a visual manifesto and a form of care as HIV/AIDS and failing sight reshape his attention to colour in Chroma and Blue."

**Places:** Lived in [Dungeness](Q911577) 1986-1994   

Derek Jarman, painter, poet, film-maker, was born in 1942 in Northwood, [Thanet](Q590422) (not quite ‘behind the great white cliffs of Dover’ as stated by Jarman in Chroma), and died at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, Smithfield in the City of London in 1994. In the last volume of his diaries _Smiling in Slow Motion_, Jarman poignantly records a fall of snow at Dungeness on 20 December 1993 and his relief at the receipt of a letter from the Reverend Ford confirming he can be buried at St Clement’s Churchyard, [Old Romney](Q2602144).

It isn’t perhaps surprising that Derek Jarman should have fallen in love with Dungeness in general and Prospect Cottage in particular when happenstance and a desire for fish and chips at the Pilot Inn brought him to [Romney Marsh](Q1506093) – the ‘fifth continent’ of the _Ingoldsby Legends_ – in 1986 at the age of 44. He would later be moved to declare: ‘Dungeness, Dungeness, your beauty is the best, forget the hills and valleys’ (in _Derek Jarman’s Garden_, his last book) and was even able to detect ‘wonderment’ in the nuclear power station.

By his own account, Jarman had no plans to build a garden, an improbable project in this ‘bleak and beautiful interzone’ (Olivia Laing), but following his purchase of Prospect Cottage for £450 (freehold) and his subsequent diagnosis as HIV positive, he set about creating the garden that would serve as ‘therapy and pharmacopoeia’ (_Derek Jarman’s Garden_). He came to see his garden as a paradise, contrasting it with other gardens he saw as ‘like bad children – spoilt by their parents, over-watered and covered with noxious chemicals’ (_Derek Jarman’s Garden_). Jarman’s garden merges imperceptibly with the beach and has no fences. ‘My garden’s boundaries are the horizon,’ he declares in _Modern Nature_.

The garden flourished in this harsh, inhospitable landscape, against the elements and the odds, but as it thrived, so Jarman’s condition worsened as AIDS tightened its grip. By 1990 his sight was failing as a result of toxoplasmosis. Typically, this prompted an obsession with colour, which would find expression in both his ‘book of colour’ _Chroma_ and his last film _Blue_.

Derek Jarman’s creativity was truly extraordinary by virtue of its scope and its exuberance. Prospect Cottage, Dungeness and Romney Marsh collectively constitute a fitting memorial to the man, the life and the work.
