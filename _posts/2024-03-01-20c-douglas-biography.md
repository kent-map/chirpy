Keith Douglas was a soldier and a war poet who fought in and wrote about World War 2. Some of his most notable works was his military memoir 'Alamein to Zem Zem', which was published 2 years after his death, in 1946, as well as 'Desert Flower', published in 1943.

# Life and Death

Douglas was born on 24th January [1920](Q2155), in [Tunbridge Wells](Q665489), [Kent](Q23298). He was killed in action when fighting in the [invasion of Normandy](Q16471) on 9th June [1944](Q5268), merely 24 years old.

# Early Life

Douglas experienced a bleak childhood growing up; when he was 4 years old, his mother collapsed of [encephalitis lethargica](Q3053951) (a condition often dubbed as 'the sleeping sickness'), which she never fully recovered from, and he had a strained relationship with his father. His parents separated 2 years later, and Douglas spent most of his school years in boarding schools.

# Education

Douglas then completed the entrance exam to [Christ's Hospital](Q677579), which was a charity school, and attended from [1931](Q18782)-[1938](Q18645); it was there that his poetic abilities were recognised and nurtured. He then completed his university at [Oxford](Q34433), with a degree in History and English.

# Military Service

Douglas was eager to join the military service and signed up mere days after the declaration of war, but it was not until July [1940](Q18633) when he started his training. He completed his training at the renowned Royal Military College Sandhurst. After being positioned at various areas of [Northern Africa](Q27381), Douglas, who was now [Captain](Q19100), returned to England in [1943](Q18623) and took part of the [D-Day](Q16470) invasion of [Normandy](Q15878), where he unfortunately lost his life. He was temporarily buried by a hedge close to where he died, by Captain Leslie Skinner, before being relocated to the [Tilly-sur-Seulles War Cemetery](Q17624909) in Normandy, [France](Q142).
