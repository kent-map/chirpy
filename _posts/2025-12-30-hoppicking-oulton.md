title: "Hop Picking"
description: "Hop picking in Kent emerges through shifting literary and personal images, from Dickens and Eden Phillpotts to Orwell and a wartime schoolgirl’s recollection. Seasonal labor becomes a lens on class, health beliefs, and the felt texture of place, where hop dust, injured fingers, and remembered streets bind countryside work to nearby Canterbury."

[Dickens]({{ site.baseurl }}/dickens) sees bodies wet in the hedges,   

hop dust is believed to cure consumption.   
Eden Phillpotts, writing in 1916,   
starts with sunshine and deft fingered girls.   
By the 1930s and Orwell it’s blood   
all over the fingers and chaff in the throat.

But for Eileen one January morning, hops   
nailed to the ceiling brittle as dust,   
in the home where she now lives?   
Her school at one end of [Canterbury]({{ site.baseurl }}/20c-canterbury-ww2)
was bombed. I didn’t know   
it had a chapel.

They were let out early   
for hop picking. Wincheap.   
I’ve got smoke-stained alleys   
and the carpet shop. Like a holiday   
she says, she could go there   
now and see it all again.
