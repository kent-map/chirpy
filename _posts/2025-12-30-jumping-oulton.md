title: "Jumping Downs"
description: "This essay presents a poem by Carolyn Oulton that closely observes grasses, thistle, clover, and fleeting bodily sensations in a field setting, linking attention to landscape with the act of writing. It frames the countryside as both a lived environment and a source of literary texture, where small details carry memory and meaning."

With my head in position that butterfly wing   
is the shadow of a line of grass -   
just there the bone of a fallen thistle,   
a boot hook. Coming up   
the pink of my legs went cobweb,   
an unnecessary detail.        This space is where   
I wrote for fun with the point of a straw,   
the brushing of the air a few inches up,   
no ink or sound or colour for.   
Those fields falling over themselves   
are going to miss it, the touch   
of a spider climbing my shoulder,   
the red-tinged clover,   
spilled tea shadows,   
purple flowers as they tick tock tick.
