title: "Brockhill Park, Sunday Afternoon"
description: "This essay presents a contemporary poem set in Brockhill Country Park near Hythe, using close sensory detail to capture rain, stream, and the pull of the nearby sea. It frames the park as a literary place where landscape and memory blur into a tense, private moment of drifting and self-erasure."

A few feet away, the child is waiting.   

Strands of rain, wind’s pummelling,   
salt sun (even a woman, bent   
like a pause in conversation)   
have left that day intact.

Today the day after that day   
means tomorrow. I know at once   
this is tomorrow. Grass that is almost   
too green to be not quite pink,   
a leaf glazed on the mudbank.

Lumpy stones trudge across the stream,   
holding my foot as my body   
slides like foam, water reaching   
for my toes. Another moment -   
I am climbing the arch of a tree.

No. Not that.   
But I take off my watch,   
prod a stick   
in the direction of the sea.   
Tell no one where I am.
