title: "Brockhill Park, Sunday Afternoon"
description: "A short lyric poem set in Brockhill Country Park near Hythe, where rain, grass, stones, and stream water sharpen a sense of time slipping between days. It uses the park’s coastal-edge landscape to stage quiet risk, movement, and bodily attention, ending with a gesture of secrecy and orientation toward the sea."

A few feet away, the child is waiting.   

Strands of rain, wind’s pummelling,   
salt sun (even a woman, bent   
like a pause in conversation)   
have left that day intact.

Today the day after that day   
means tomorrow. I know at once   
this is tomorrow. Grass that is almost   
too green to be not quite pink,   
a leaf glazed on the mudbank.

Lumpy stones trudge across the stream,   
holding my foot as my body   
slides like foam, water reaching   
for my toes. Another moment -   
I am climbing the arch of a tree.

No. Not that.   
But I take off my watch,   
prod a stick   
in the direction of the sea.   
Tell no one where I am.
