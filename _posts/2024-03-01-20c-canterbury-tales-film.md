title: "20th-Century Canterbury: A Canterbury Tale"
description: "This essay explores how the 1944 film A Canterbury Tale reimagines Chaucer’s medieval pilgrimage within wartime Canterbury, linking physical travel to spiritual and cultural inheritance. It considers how the Blitz heightens the film’s emphasis on intangible literary heritage and collective memory, and how modern memorials and tourism connect Chaucer to the contemporary city."

Directors [Michael Powell](Q55234) and [Emeric Pressburger](Q55230) pay homage to [Geoffrey Chaucer](/14c/14c-chaucer-biography)'s work in their 1944 film *[A Canterbury Tale](Q133466)*, where the characters willingly or unwillingly follow in the footsteps of the old pilgrims and even feel their presence. The physical and spiritual journey of the characters encourages the audience to have a closer relationship with their national, local, and family heritage. During [The Blitz](Q6900329), which endangered the British historical architecture, the film points to the importance of the intangible heritage. The celebration of national writers like Chaucer and his international readers "further allow us to understand literary heritage as a project of collective memory”. Contrary to Powell's pilgrims, the pilgrims in the Tales never reached Canterbury and as Carolyn Oulton clarifies: “there is no hard evidence that Chaucer did either”. Finally, Chaucer's statue found itself in the city in 2016 and connects the medieval pilgrims with the modern tourists walking down the High Street.
